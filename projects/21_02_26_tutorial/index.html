     <h2 id="introduction">chapter; planets1</h2>
     <p><b>Our solar system</b><i> has eight</i> recognized planets orbiting the Sun, formed roughly 5 billion years ago. They are divided into four rocky inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) and four outer gas/ice giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune). The planets vary in size, composition, and distance, with Earth being the only known world to support</p>

     <h2 id="earth">chapter2: earth</h2>
     <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is made possible by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is at least somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large ice sheets at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers, and atmospheric water combined.</p>


     <h2 id="saturn">saturn</h2>
     <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant, with an average radius of about 9 times that of Earth. It has an eighth of the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive. Even though Saturn is almost as big as Jupiter, Saturn has less than a third of its mass. Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU (1,434 million km), with an orbital period of 29.45 years.</p>


     <h2 id="jupiter">jupiter</h2>
     <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in our Solar System, with a mass over 300 times that of Earth. As a gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, it features iconic, colorful cloud bands and the massive Great Red Spot storm. It has at least 92 moons—including the four large Galilean moons—and a faint ring system.
